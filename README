Enom Integration for Drupal 7.x
Uses rules
Easy integration with Drupal Commerce

Example workflow 1:
* User creates node with a domain name field. Perhaps this is simply the node title.
* Client side ajax validation before page submit tells user if itâ€™s available or not.
* Do we need a specific cck type field for client side validation to work correctly? Perhaps this could be a setting where the validator simply looks for an html element id and validates the text string within it.
* Rules trigger is on node save.
* Rules action is to register the domain based on the field argument.

Example workflow 2:
* Customer wishes to purchase domain
* Vsits product (display?) node.
* Domain registration specific page with domain registration form. Single text field.
* Client side validation.
* The submit button adds to order and takes user to checkout
* Rule trigger is order with balance < 0
* Action takes argument (how do we pass the domain name?) and registers domain name.
